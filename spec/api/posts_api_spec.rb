Images may be automatically recompressed to ≤ ~1MB to satisfy Bluesky&#39;s blob limit. When no media is attached, a link preview may be generated for URLs in the text. - Snapchat requires media (single image or video); set contentType to &#39;story&#39;, &#39;saved_story&#39;, or &#39;spotlight&#39; in platformSpecificData. Stories are ephemeral (24h), Saved Stories are permanent, Spotlight is for video content.  **Multi-page/multi-location posting:** Some platforms allow posting to multiple pages, organizations, or locations from a single account connection. Use the same accountId multiple times with different targets in platformSpecificData: - Facebook: &#x60;pageId&#x60; - post to multiple Facebook Pages (list via GET /v1/accounts/{id}/facebook-page) - LinkedIn: &#x60;organizationUrn&#x60; - post to multiple organizations (list via GET /v1/accounts/{id}/linkedin-organizations) - Google Business: &#x60;locationId&#x60; - post to multiple locations (list via GET /v1/accounts/{id}/gmb-locations) - Reddit: &#x60;subreddit&#x60; - post to multiple subreddits from the same account
