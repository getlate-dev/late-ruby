  # unit tests for get_analytics
  # Unified analytics for posts
  # Returns analytics for posts. If postId is provided, returns analytics for a single post. Otherwise returns a paginated list of posts with overview stats.  **Important: Understanding Post IDs**  This endpoint uses two types of posts: - **Late Posts** - Posts scheduled/created via the Late API (e.g., via &#x60;POST /v1/posts&#x60;) - **External Posts** - Posts synced from social platforms for analytics tracking  When you schedule a post via Late and it gets published, **both** records exist: 1. The original Late Post (returned when you created the post) 2. An External Post (created when we sync analytics from the platform)  **List endpoint behavior:** - Returns External Post IDs (&#x60;_id&#x60; field) - Use the &#x60;isExternal&#x60; field to identify post origin:   - &#x60;isExternal: true&#x60; - Synced from platform (may have been originally scheduled via Late)   - &#x60;isExternal: false&#x60; - Late-scheduled post (shown when querying by Late post ID)  **Single post behavior (&#x60;postId&#x60; parameter):** - Accepts **both** Late Post IDs and External Post IDs - If you pass a Late Post ID, the API automatically resolves it to the corresponding External Post analytics - Both return the same analytics data for the same underlying social media post  **Correlating posts:** Use &#x60;latePostId&#x60; to link analytics entries back to the original post created via &#x60;POST /v1/posts&#x60;. This field contains the Late Post ID when the external post originated from Late. Alternatively, use &#x60;platformPostUrl&#x60; (e.g., &#x60;https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/&#x60;) as a stable identifier.  **Note:** For follower count history and growth metrics, use the dedicated &#x60;/v1/accounts/follower-stats&#x60; endpoint.  **LinkedIn Analytics:** - **Personal Accounts:** Per-post analytics available for posts published through Late. External posts cannot be synced due to LinkedIn API restrictions. - **Organization Accounts:** Full analytics support including external post syncing.  **Telegram Analytics:** - **Not available.** The Telegram Bot API does not provide message view counts, forwards, or engagement metrics. This is a Telegram platform limitation, not a Late limitation. View counts are only visible to channel admins in the Telegram app.  **Data Freshness:** Analytics data is cached and refreshed at most once per hour. When you call this endpoint, if the cache is older than 60 minutes, a background refresh is triggered and you&#39;ll see updated data on subsequent requests. There is no rate limit on API requests. 
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :post_id Returns analytics for a single post. Accepts both Late Post IDs (from &#x60;POST /v1/posts&#x60;)  and External Post IDs (from this endpoint&#39;s list response). The API automatically  resolves Late Post IDs to their corresponding External Post analytics. 
  # @option opts [String] :platform Filter by platform (default \&quot;all\&quot;)
  # @option opts [String] :profile_id Filter by profile ID (default \&quot;all\&quot;)
  # @option opts [String] :source Filter by post source: - &#x60;late&#x60; - Only posts scheduled/published via Late API - &#x60;external&#x60; - Only posts synced from the platform (not posted via Late) - &#x60;all&#x60; - All posts (default) 
  # @option opts [Date] :from_date Inclusive lower bound
  # @option opts [Date] :to_date Inclusive upper bound
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit Page size (default 50)
  # @option opts [Integer] :page Page number (default 1)
  # @option opts [String] :sort_by Sort by date or engagement

  # unit tests for get_follower_stats
  # Get follower stats and growth metrics
  # Returns follower count history and growth metrics for connected social accounts. **Requires analytics add-on subscription.**  **Data Freshness:** Follower counts are automatically refreshed once per day.

  # unit tests for get_linked_in_aggregate_analytics
  # Get aggregate analytics for a LinkedIn personal account
  # Returns aggregate analytics across ALL posts for a LinkedIn personal account. Uses LinkedIn&#39;s &#x60;memberCreatorPostAnalytics&#x60; API with &#x60;q&#x3D;me&#x60; finder.  **Important:** This endpoint only works for LinkedIn **personal** accounts. Organization accounts should use the standard &#x60;/v1/analytics&#x60; endpoint for per-post analytics.  **Required Scope:** &#x60;r_member_postAnalytics&#x60;  If the connected account doesn&#39;t have this scope, you&#39;ll receive a 403 error with instructions to reconnect.  **Aggregation Options:** - &#x60;TOTAL&#x60; (default): Returns lifetime totals for all metrics - &#x60;DAILY&#x60;: Returns daily breakdown of metrics over time  **Available Metrics:** - &#x60;IMPRESSION&#x60;: Number of times posts were displayed - &#x60;MEMBERS_REACHED&#x60;: Unique members who saw posts (NOT available with DAILY aggregation) - &#x60;REACTION&#x60;: Total reactions (likes, celebrates, etc.) - &#x60;COMMENT&#x60;: Total comments - &#x60;RESHARE&#x60;: Total reshares/reposts  **Date Range Filtering:** Use &#x60;startDate&#x60; and &#x60;endDate&#x60; parameters to filter analytics to a specific time period. If omitted, returns lifetime analytics.  **LinkedIn API Limitation:** The combination of &#x60;MEMBERS_REACHED&#x60; + &#x60;DAILY&#x60; aggregation is not supported by LinkedIn&#39;s API. 
  # @param account_id The ID of the LinkedIn personal account
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :aggregation Type of aggregation for the analytics data. - &#x60;TOTAL&#x60; (default): Returns single totals for each metric - &#x60;DAILY&#x60;: Returns daily breakdown of metrics  Note: &#x60;MEMBERS_REACHED&#x60; metric is not available with &#x60;DAILY&#x60; aggregation. 
  # @option opts [Date] :start_date Start date for analytics data in YYYY-MM-DD format. If provided without endDate, endDate defaults to today. If omitted entirely, returns lifetime analytics. 
  # @option opts [Date] :end_date End date for analytics data in YYYY-MM-DD format (exclusive). If provided without startDate, startDate defaults to 30 days before endDate. 
  # @option opts [String] :metrics Comma-separated list of metrics to fetch. If omitted, fetches all available metrics. Valid values: IMPRESSION, MEMBERS_REACHED, REACTION, COMMENT, RESHARE

  # unit tests for get_linked_in_post_analytics
  # Get analytics for a specific LinkedIn post by URN
  # Returns analytics for a specific LinkedIn post using its URN. Works for both personal and organization accounts.  This is useful for fetching analytics of posts that weren&#39;t published through Late, as long as you have the post URN.  **For Personal Accounts:** - Uses &#x60;memberCreatorPostAnalytics&#x60; API + &#x60;memberCreatorVideoAnalytics&#x60; for video posts - Requires &#x60;r_member_postAnalytics&#x60; scope - Available metrics: impressions, reach, likes, comments, shares, video views (video posts only) - **Clicks are NOT available** for personal accounts  **For Organization Accounts:** - Uses &#x60;organizationalEntityShareStatistics&#x60; API + &#x60;videoAnalytics&#x60; for video posts - Requires &#x60;r_organization_social&#x60; scope - Available metrics: impressions, reach, clicks, likes, comments, shares, video views (video posts only), engagement rate

  # unit tests for get_you_tube_daily_views
  # YouTube daily views breakdown
  # Returns historical daily view counts for a specific YouTube video. Uses YouTube Analytics API v2 to fetch daily breakdowns including views, watch time, and subscriber changes.  **Required Scope:** This endpoint requires the &#x60;yt-analytics.readonly&#x60; OAuth scope. Existing YouTube accounts may need to re-authorize to grant this permission. If the scope is missing, the response will include a &#x60;reauthorizeUrl&#x60;.  **Data Latency:** YouTube Analytics data has a 2-3 day delay. The &#x60;endDate&#x60; is automatically capped to 3 days ago.  **Date Range:** Maximum 90 days of historical data available. Defaults to last 30 days. 
  # @param video_id The YouTube video ID (e.g., \&quot;dQw4w9WgXcQ\&quot;)
  # @param account_id The Late account ID for the YouTube account
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Date] :start_date Start date (YYYY-MM-DD). Defaults to 30 days ago.
